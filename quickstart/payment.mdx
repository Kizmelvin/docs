## Overview

Managing recurring payments can be difficult especially if you have to rely on card payments; cards often fail due to insufficient funds or expiry, leading to payment disruptions. These issues create unpredictable cash flow for the business, increase operational costs, and make it harder to maintain a steady revenue stream.

Mono Direct Debit solves this by allowing businesses to collect recurring payments directly from customers' bank accounts on schedule, without using cards. By automating collections and removing manual processing, businesses can reduce payment failures, maintain a steady cash flow, and ensure predictable revenue.

This quick start guide provides clear steps on how to integrate the Mono Direct Debit API into your product, with detailed instructions and sample API requests to help you set up automated payments efficiently.
