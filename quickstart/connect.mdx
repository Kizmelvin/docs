## Overview

As a credit business, making accurate risk assessment decisions is often challenging. This is because finding reliable ways to retrieve customers’ financial data, determine the maximum amount to lend to them, or assess their capacity to repay loans is hard.

The Mono Connect API product helps you solve these problems by making it easier to access customers’ verified bank statements and better understand their financial behaviour. This empowers you with accurate insights into users’ cash flow and finance patterns, so you can make data-informed lending decisions and lend the right amount of money to the right person.

This quick start guide will show you how to integrate the Mono Connect API into your product, with clear steps and sample requests for the entire process.
